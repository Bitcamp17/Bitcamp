Design Plan:
1) Calendar to plan out days (api google calendar)
2) Set up geofencing to monitor different GPS locations
	time spent in class
	time spent in library
	time spent in gym
3) Keep record of where times spent (timestamp entering - timestamp leaving fence)
4) Competition between friends
	ie I spent avg of 30 minutes at the gym on the 3 days this week I went
	pie chart presentation

5) "Poke" friends like on facebook if you are at the gym, going to the library, etc
7) Include messenger fucntionality 

MISC:
Useful APIs:
UMD.io
google maps 
bitcamp api
Groupme, facebook messenger
sync with elms api/ canvas api/ google calendar for CLASS SCHEDULE

Notes:
Data saved on user's phone
	history can be viewed offline
	takes up more memory
alt: Google maps api to moniter location instead of geofencing
	- more detailed information on user location
	- Ex: how much walking do you do?

Needs Met:
Awareness about where you are spending (or wasting) your time.
Accountability for going to class, gym, library. (esp if friends view your days)
