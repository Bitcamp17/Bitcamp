Design Plan
1) Print question on screen "Are you going to class?"
2) Acknowledge "yes" / "no" button response
	2a) Keep calendar of when you were in class & when you were not
	2b) Folder to upload class notes
3) Send response to 'friends' in same class
	- only if press "no"
	- *phone is responsible for initiating sending this information, not a network
4) Set up easy scheduling/time-based trigger to push this question to user
5) Set up geofencing to monitor GPS location
	- have you left "Home", have you arrived at "Class"?
6) Combine time-trigget and geofencing: Ping friends if you haven't left for class by a certain time

7) Build in functionality for friends to call (via app) user who is SLEEPING THOUGH CLASS
	- Rohit's "call dave" function
	- #include messenger functionality 

MISC:
Useful APIs:
UMD.io
google maps 
bitcamp api
Groupme, facebook messenger
sync with elms api/ canvas api/ google calendar for CLASS SCHEDULE

Notes:
If phone is off / app uninstalled, will not ping friends
	- (because user's phone is responsible for pinging friends)
	- alt: data saved on a server (ping friends if location DOES NOT check in to fence)
Google maps api to moniter location instead of geofencing
	- more detailed information on user location
	- (ex: are you en route halfway to class?)

Needs Met:
Accountability for going to class
Note-sharing interface
	-(know your classmate isn't present and will need the notes)
	- built-in messenger for absent student to ask friends to take notes for them

Risks:
Security risk -- GPS location from phone
